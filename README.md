Project is to recreate the Google.com homepage: https://www.google.com (cached ver: https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/). This is mostly a project to practice placing elements on the page with html and change the display using css. Links, search, etc do nothing.

This project took longer than expected but was a good practice of the following:
-learning how elements are displayed by default.
-learning how to use classes and ids better.
-practice different types of display properties (absolute, fixed, flex, etc).

Difficult version of project is to build the results page: https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage. The current layout of results page has a number of different styles not yet encountered and icons not used in the homepage, so rather than spending loads of time on these I plan to return to this optional assignment later.
